# Fighting-malware-using-machine-learning

To run this program, follow these steps:

For this program to work, it needs the following files:
    classificationAlgorithm.pkl  a trained Scikit-Learn classification algorithm
    detectionAlgorithm.pkl       a trained Scikit-Learn classification algorithm
    algorithmConfig.pkl          a file containing the config of the algorithms
    
It also requires the following libraries to be installed:
    Capstone        pip install Capstone==3.0.5rc2
                    http://www.capstone-engine.org/documentation.html
                    http://www.capstone-engine.org/download.html          
    Docopt          pip install Docopt==0.6.2
    numpy           pip install numpy
    scipy           pip install scipy
    progressbar     pip install brogressbar2
    Pickle          pip install pickle
    pyparsing       pip install pyparsing
    sklearn         conda install scikit-learn
                    pip install -U scikit-learn    
Usage:
    malware_predict.py -i <file>
    malware_predict.py -d <file>
    malware_predict.py -b <file>
    malware_predict.py -f -i <folder>
    malware_predict.py -f -d <folder>
    malware_predict.py -f -b <folder>
Options:
    -i      specify file name to be analysed with IDA Pro files
    -d      specify file name to be analysed with files to be disassembled
            disassembled
    -b      specify file name to be analysed with text files containing binary
    -f      specify folder name to be analysed
    -h      show this screen

Example of command: python malware_predict.py -f -i asm_files

Both bytes_files and asm_files are folders containing sample data from the 'Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge'
To get all the data from the challenge, download it here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data

This program can also be used on files that are not from the 'Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge'
such as the helloworld.exe program included in this project.
